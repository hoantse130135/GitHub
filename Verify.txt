	Nowadays, with a huge work for a day, a great number of people have been stressed. Almost them think negatively that smoking is like a way to help them fell 
comfortable. Therefore, more and more people smoke although they know it's the most quickly way to make them to be cancer. They never think that their own family 
and people around them had to be similar. In my own conceit, smoking must be banned in public places.

	First of all, smoking should be banned because of ciggaret's chemical composition. Ciggaret is a addictive substance. It makes you can not quit it. Not only that,
but it also make them and us-who smell its smokecloud to be cancer, breath diseases and so on. Take for example, imagine that your father smokes and your family smell it 
everyday in a couple of year. It is definitely terrible, in a soon day, whole family will be sick. Money, heathy, everything are discreased.
